      'matching works and get_online_gallery_detail when necessary to obtain '
      'their full tags. Separate stable identity features (hair, eyes, '
      'distinctive accessories) from outfits/forms/versions, pose, background, '
      'other characters and artist/style tags. Do not copy all tags from one '

      'and explain the tradeoffs. Questions clarify preferences, not tool '
